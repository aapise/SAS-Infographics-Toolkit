###Project Description

The goal of this project was to design and build a prototype for an infographics toolkit for SAS. Such a toolkit
can help data report designers build customized reports that include visualizations, images, and other elements combined to convey a story. The scope of the project was to design the prototype and build wireframes for the toolkit and carry out extensive usability testing in order to ensure a good user experience. Based on a use-case document that was provided to us by SAS, we developed a detailed design specification and a low‐fidelity prototype. Additionally, we also implemented a high fidelity prototype that supported a subset of the use cases that were supported in the low‐fidelity prototype.

###Project Objectives
..*To design a tool set that will provide the users with maximum flexibility and usability for
building an infographics.
..*To help the users build an infographics by facilitating the superimposition of context over
visualizations.
..*To provide the users with the ability to handle data that may change dynamically.
..*To design a toolkit that would help create data reports that are more interactive.

##Technologies used
1. Balsamiq Mockups to build wireframes for the low fidelity prototype.
2. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, D3.js for the high fidelity prototype.
