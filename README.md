##Project Description
The goal of this project was to design and build a prototype for an infographics toolkit for SAS. Such a toolkit
can help data report designers build customized reports that include visualizations, images, and other elements combined to convey a story. The scope of the project was to design the prototype and build wireframes for the toolkit and carry out extensive usability testing in order to ensure a good user experience. Based on a use-case document that was provided to by SAS, a detailed design specification and a low‐fidelity prototype was developed. Additionally,a high fidelity prototype was also implemented that supported a subset of the use cases that were supported in the low‐fidelity prototype.

##Project Objectives
  * To design a tool set that will provide the users with maximum flexibility and usability for
building an infographics.
  * To help the users build an infographics by facilitating the superimposition of context over
visualizations.
  * To provide the users with the ability to handle data that may change dynamically.
  * To design a toolkit that would help create data reports that are more interactive.

##Technologies Used
1. Balsamiq Mockups to build wireframes for the low fidelity prototype.
2. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, D3.js for the high fidelity prototype.

##The Process
The design process began with paper sketches which led to the first Balsamiq wireframe as shown below:

![Initial Prototype](https://github.com/aapise/SAS-Infographics-Toolkit/blob/master/Docs%2C%20Reports%20and%20Screencast/InitialPrototype.jpg)

A formative evaluation of the initial prototype was carried out.

After many iterations of design and testing, a final prototype was created using the Blasamiq Mockups.
